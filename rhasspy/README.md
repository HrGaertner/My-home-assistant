Install the home assistant addon for rhasspy following [this](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/#hassio) tutorial.

Set up the moduls following [this tutorial](http://192.168.178.115:12101/docs/tutorials/#getting-started-guide)

Set up marytts following [this tutorial](https://blog.bickle.co.uk/podcasts/marytts-voice-synthesizer-how-to-for-debian/) and change the rhasspy settings to marytts (notice that you have to use the jre of java 8 because java 7 is no longer available)
